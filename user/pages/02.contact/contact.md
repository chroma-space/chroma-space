### Biography

Katharine Vega @kategenevieve is an artist and researcher at chroma.space, the artist group she founded in 2010. Her projects explore the flexible relationship between the physical and the virtual, the real world and imagined ones. The work brings experimental performance together with immersive and interactive technologies, so that the audience’s perception, bodies and movement become a vital part of the action.

Art and performance work has shown nationally and internationally with recent work at the touring exhibition on female digital artists Technology is Not Neutral 2016-2017, Nimes 2016, London’s Science Museum, Brighton Digital Festival and FACT Liverpool. 

Katharine is working on a practice-based PHD at the University of Sussex, researching multi-sensory integration, shared experience in virtual and mixed reality and why humans find it so hard to take in the information about the climate crisis. She has taught on digital art, creative media and animation at the Universities of Sussex and Brighton and run numerous open workshops for all ages.

### About the company

chroma.space is an artists group creating work that combines performance and narrative with immersive interactivity. Inspired by cybernetics and a sense of the deep connection between mental, social and environmental ecology, projects collaborate across disciplines, bringing in diverse perspectives from dance to architecture, magic to neuroscience, social change to mathematics.

The creative work invites people to move out of their comfort zone and into fresh terrain and the audience’s perception, bodies and movement are vital to the action. chroma.space runs open labs, public events and workshops on the potentials that improvisation, creative technologies and open source culture have for transforming how we communicate, act together and receive information about the earth.
