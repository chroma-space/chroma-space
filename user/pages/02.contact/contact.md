### Biography

Kate is an artist and researcher at C H R Θ M A 

Her projects explore the flexible relationship between the physical and the virtual, the real world and imagined ones. The work brings experimental performance together with immersive and interactive technologies, so that the audience’s perception, bodies and movement become a vital part of the action. 

C H R Θ M A was formed to creatively explore and question the implications technology and science have on how we understand ourselves as humans in the ecosphere. Inspired by cybernetics and ecological thinking, C H R Θ M A projects collaborate across disciplines, bringing in diverse perspectives from dance to architecture, magic to neuroscience, anthropology to physics. 

Kate is working on a practice-based PHD at Sussex University, with supervision at the Media School and the Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science. Her research uses virtual reality and immersive environments to investigate multi-sensory experience, embodiment and non-verbal means of communication.

Kate lectures on digital art, creative media and animation at the Universities of Sussex and Brighton.
