TRANSMUTE gathered artists, dancers and critical
thinkers working with digital technology to

CHROMA and Stillpoint residency at Cove Park 2015 Cove Park, Scotland June 2015
Nightingale Arts and Cove Park 
In collaboration with Rachel Blackman, I developed
and performed Transmission a new audience-led,
cross platform, live art installation exploring
empathy and creative agency as tools for
viscerally engaging with each other and the
climate crisis. I went into residency for a week
at Cove Park Scotland with Rachel Blackman to
develop sense responsive, choreographic, sonic and
visual elements for this piece. We performed the
outcome of this at The Spire in November 2015.

The Nightingale mentored our creative production
and subsidised our residency at Cove Park in
Scotland and continue to provide production help.
