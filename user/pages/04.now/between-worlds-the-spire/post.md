Live event exploring non-verbal communication: how we perceive and receive across space without words using sound, touch, feeling, light, symbols. We - Louis D'aboville, Rachel Blackman, Kate Genevieve - are interested in the possibilities of empathy and technology for ecology, activism and playful creativity. This night includes a sound ritual from Isobel Anderson, a fibre optic installation from Maf'j Alvarez, data projections from Kate Genevieve and Simon Wibberley and a Virtual Reality experience from Dr Keisuke Suzuki. There will be Sufi dance, live drawing from scribe-of-the-unconscious Will Scobie, music from Tom Beaufoy (Evil 9) and a chance to share an intimate moment with a stranger across the dark side of a mirror in Chroma and Stillpoint's Transmission. 

The evening begins with a fire ritual at 5pm where we offer you a chance to let go of something that no longer serves your life. Have something ready to burn.
