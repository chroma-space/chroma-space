##Art and the Scientific Study of Consciousness panel at State of Mind Expo

Impulse featured in the Sackler Centre's State of Mind Expo at the Corn Exchange in June 2012. Kate curated an Art & Neuroscience talks panel and film programme for the event. The panel on Art and the Scientific Study of Consciousness brought together artists Gordana Novakovic, Jane Grant, Maria Lopes and Kate to discuss and debate how artists are investigating, exploring and making their own contribution to the scientific study of consciousness.
