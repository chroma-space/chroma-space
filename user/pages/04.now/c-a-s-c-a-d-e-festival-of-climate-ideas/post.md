C A S C A D E @  [Festival of Climate Ideas](http://onca.org.uk/upcoming-events/)
 
During Onca Network's Festival of Climate Ideas, we are initiating a new project – C A S C A D E

C A S C A D E is an experiment in creative activism & storytelling - created across many different media streams by many different people - imagining into alternative futures for the human race on earth at this time. We’ll be in the gallery growing the project until December 4th and then in Paris during the COP21 - open invitation to come create in situ around different ways of living, working & being together. December 2nd opening night is followed by a screening of Naomi Klein's This Changes Everything from the Brighton Radical Film Festival.
