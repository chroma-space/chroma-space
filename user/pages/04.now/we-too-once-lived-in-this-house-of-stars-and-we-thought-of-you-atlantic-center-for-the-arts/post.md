 We too once lived in this house of stars, and we thought of you @  [Atlantic Center for the Arts](http://atlanticcenterforthearts.org/)

An outdoor AV interactive experiment in wild Florida: the land the Voyager probes were launched from in 1977. The Voyager record emphasises the “homo musicus”. The Golden Record is laden with music and sonic material as a mode to communicate the quality of experience and emotional dimension of being human.  This performance experiment will invite you into a strange communication at a point when Spacex rockets are launching from Cape Canaveral and the tone, aesthetic and character of space investigation is shifting. 

This showing of work is part of the Inside Out event, a group showing by artists, writers & musicians on Residency 161 - with input from Kate Genevieve, Ben Zucker, Shannon Novak and Farnaz Fatemi - [Of the Spheres] (http://ofthespheres.com/)
