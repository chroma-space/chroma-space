 C H R Θ M A, Brightonart and Two Tigers Fireworks joined forces for the second year running to create a Son et lumière show for Camp Bestival 2012. The projected animation tells the story of some unlikely Olympic contenders taking up the challenge of the Games, the team was joined this year by the animation company Persistent Peril.

The Heritage site, Lulworth Castle, was illuminated on the 29th June by animation projections and synchronized fireworks following Sunday's headline act, the Happy Mondays.  The show provided the finale for the music festival curated by Rob and Josie da Bank.

The Finale show was directed by Kate Genevieve (C H R Θ M A) and Richard Cranmer (Two Tiger Fireworks) who worked together to create a show that blended animation with pyrotechnics: precisely timed explosions allow animated characters to vault off the top of the building and turn into fireworks.  The project received a lot of coverage and a write up on Computer Arts Blogs.
