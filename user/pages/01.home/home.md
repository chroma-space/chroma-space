<a href="http://chroma.space/" target="_blank" class="green" >chroma.space</a> is a creative studio investigating the flexible relationship between the physical and the virtual, the real world and imagined.  Inspired by cybernetics and ecological thinking, we collaborate across disciplines, bringing in diverse perspectives - from dance to architecture, magic to neuroscience, anthropology to physics - to feel out alternatives on the horizon.

chroma.space is a space for experimentation in the making. Older projects documented at <a href="http://cargocollective.com/chromacollective/" target="_blank">archive.chroma.space</a>
