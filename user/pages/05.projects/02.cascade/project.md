The [Cascade Network](https://cascade.network/) explores how to mobilise the creative and radical potentials of emerging digital technologies like Virtual Reality and the Blockchain towards supporting cultural sovereignty for communities on the move. 

A self-organised, collaborative experiment, that took us to the streets of Paris during the COP21 - the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference - story telling, chalking doors, planting seeds, sending messages.  It grew out of the wreckage of Byzantium https://chroma.space/projects/byzantium  into a series of creative workshops on Buckminster Fuller & group synergetics, transmedia storytelling, cybernetics and hacking reality and found form in the ongoing collaboration [cascade.network](https://cascade.network/).

The Vanuatu-based NGO [Further Arts](http://www.furtherarts.org/) has been asked to support the Ambae community in recording the stories of the island as theÂ community makes permanent evacuation to nearby islands. The network works together with the intention that - with trust, care and mutual respect - the progressive technological solutions emerging can strengthen and respect creative cultural ownership and diverse ways of knowing.
