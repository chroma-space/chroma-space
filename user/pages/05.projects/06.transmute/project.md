> “The night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow...” // Frank Herbert, Dune

<span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> & Stillpoint curated a night of experimental performance, artwork, interventions, sound experiments and spoken word for the Brighton Digital Festival 2014. Held on the cusp between Summer and Autumn, TRANSMUTE celebrated uncertainty & improvisation: a playful experiment to provoke imaginative ways of moving through the dark nights ahead.

TRANSMUTE gathered artists, dancers and critical thinkers working with digital technology to explore the visceral and the sensory and to feel out the possibilities of what radical change might be.

Many thanks the excellent artists, performers and speakers -
