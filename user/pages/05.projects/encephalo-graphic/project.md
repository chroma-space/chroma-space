An animated meditation on the different ways we experience and visualise music. The animation combines illustrations of brain cells by early 20th century Spanish neuroscientist Ramon y Cajal, with electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded from the collaborators, when playing and listening to the specially composed music.

The animation was projected as Richard Durrant played live, creating music with a ukulele and kaoss pad from behind gauze. The collaborators were illuminated at the points in the film that their electroencephalographic (EEG) data was visualised, so that their bodies became part of the animation.

This performance was created in collaboration with neuroscientist Anil Seth for the Arts of Life Science programme at Ropetackle.
