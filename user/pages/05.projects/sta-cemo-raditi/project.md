ŠTA ĆEMO RADITI // WHAT DO WE DO NOW? is a film experience for video head goggles made as part of Video Vortex and installed in the town centre of Komiza, Croatia on the 30th August 2011.

The audience member is asked to stand bare foot in the town square wearing video goggles and headphones. They close and open their eyes when instructed by the audiotrack, and their head is guided to follow the gaze of the film shot from a first-person perspective. Are they standing in the town centre at night or on the open pier during the glittering day? When the audience member reaches out their hand towards the horizon, in time with the filmed hand that they are seeing through the goggles, the illusion collapses as they encounter not empty space but a solid stone wall.

A collaboration between Kate Genevieve and Anja Sušanj with sound design by Vjeran Šalamon. Special thanks to the children of Komiza and our guides Ivana Franičevic and Dinko Bozanic who welcomed us to explore the life and history of the island of Vis.
