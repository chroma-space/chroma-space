On March 20th 2015 England witnessed a partial solar eclipse. Intrigued by the spectacle of the black sun that can not be looked at with the naked eye, we built a virtual reality performance as a way of marking the event.

Research into how ancient cultures understood this specific cosmological conjunction inspired us to create a virtual experience that explored the moon and the eclipse symbolically and mathematically. Made for outside viewing, we incorporated a live web cam into the virtual experience so that the viewer can see the “actual” eclipse occur in the sky above them.

Conjunction continues the [Of the Spheres](https://ofthespheres.com) project and takes the audience outside to relate to the real rythms of the earth and skies.
